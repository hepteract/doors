A Python OS running on the Linux kernel.

The Central Input/Output System (CIOS) is core of the operating system. It handles launching programs and the like. It reimplements a number of standard Linux features in its own way, including spawning programs.

### Note: This OS is not designed for production use. It is a hobby project and nothing more.
